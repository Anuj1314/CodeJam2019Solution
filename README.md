Problem: We have given a int value, we have to divide that int value into two smaller int values such that, both of that two value does not contain digit '4'.
The problem says, we are supposed to give a cheque to the winner but unfortunately the '4' digit key is not working on the printer.
So we have to break that number into two different numbers such that any of them does not conutain digit '4', so we can give two different cheques to the winner.
